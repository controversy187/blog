  <div class="post-content"><p>I&rsquo;m a technologist who&rsquo;s followed my curiosity through various roles in software development, agile leadership, and now data analytics. This blog documents my ongoing journey of learning and exploration in technology.</p>
<h2 id="professional-background">Professional Background<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#professional-background">#</a></h2>
<p>I got my start in computers by hacking around on a Commodore 64. I distinctly remember loading an ASCII bowling game, and finding out that I could see the source code before running the program. Not knowing what source code was at the time, I simply saw the word &ldquo;BOWLING&rdquo;, as it appeared on the title screen. Being in elementary school at the time, I changed it to &ldquo;POOPING&rdquo;, ran the program, saw my changes, and my life was set on a very specific course.</p>
<p>From these humble beginnings, I went on to study computer networking through college. Upon graduating, I immediately began a career in web development, because CISCO certifications are hard. Early career HTML, CSS, JS, Classic ASP and PHP got me started in the world of software development. As technologies evolved, I barely did, continuing my skillset and going moderately deep in the PHP and WordPress world. I dabbled in AWS architecture in the early AWS days, and eventually found more joy at the intersection of people and technology than I did staying heads down at the keyboard.</p>
<p>Those interests led me into the world of Agile, and I became a Scrum Master. I loved working with a small focused team, and we did a lot of things that weren&rsquo;t really Scrum, but worked well for us. I ended up drinking the Scaled Agile Framework Cool-Aid, and even did a little SAFe consulting. This led me to Portfolio Manager role.</p>
<p>Trying to scale Agile was a frustrating experience. I wasn&rsquo;t close to the work, and I didn&rsquo;t feel like I was providing value. In my free time, I was learning about machine learning, artificial intelligence, blockchain technologies, and other technological interests. My passions didn&rsquo;t lie with the Scaled Agile Framework.</p>
<p>Disillusioned with SAFe, I found an opportunity to be a product manager for a data analytics team. I took a risk and pursued it, and the manager took a risk on me and hired me. That&rsquo;s where our story begins, and the impetus for this website. I&rsquo;m learning a lot, and I want to document what I&rsquo;m learning.</p>
<h2 id="personal-background">Personal Background<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#personal-background">#</a></h2>
<p>I spend the bulk of my days in front of a computer. When I&rsquo;m not here, I like to be outside. I enjoy skiing, ultimate frisbee, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, kiteboarding, hiking, traveling, and pretty much anything active. I like to do these things with family as much as possible, and I also enjoy amateur videography. That allows me to capture memories in a compelling way that I can enjoy with my wife and kids, and extended family.</p>
