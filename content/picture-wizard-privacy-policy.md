## 1. Information We Collect
We collect the following types of information when you use our App:

The text prompts you enter.

Reference images you may optionally upload.

The final images generated by the AI.

Usage and History Data: To provide features like your in-app gallery, we store a history of your generations. This includes the generated image, the prompt used, and a timestamp.

Transaction Information: If you purchase credits, the transaction is processed by Google Play Billing. We receive verification of the purchase to update your credit balance but do not receive or store your payment card details.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information with the following third-party service providers to operate our App:

Google (Firebase & Google Cloud): We use Firebase services for user authentication, database storage (Firestore), file storage (Cloud Storage), and backend functions. Your data is stored and processed on Google's infrastructure.

Google (Play Billing): We use Google Play to process in-app purchases.

## 4. Data Storage and Security
Your information, including your generated images and account data, is stored using Firebase Storage and Firestore, which are services provided by Google. We take reasonable measures to protect your information, including securing API keys and using code obfuscation as recommended for production applications. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.
