## Why?
Does the internet need another blog? Definitively, no. Do I have original insights that you will benefit from reading? Most likely not. So what's the point of this blog?

I recently changed jobs, and I'm learning a lot. I retain information better when I describe it to someone. I also have a fear that if I constantly regurgitate my ongoing education to my close family, they will eventually want to murder me. That's where this blog comes in. I'm going to teach you what I'm learning, so I can learn it better.

Inevitably, I'll forget about this blog. Posts will become less frequent, and then stop completely. At some point, I'll just stop writing here completely. After a while, I'll find a new use for my domain name, and this will cease to exist, except in the ever growing dataset of archive.org. So, let's get on with it!
