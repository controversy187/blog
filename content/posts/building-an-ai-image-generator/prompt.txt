I want you to write me a blog post about how I created my android app, Picture Wizard. I describe the app in the PROJECT_PLAN.md and my progress in the TIMELINE.md . Only use these for context for your writing, don't reference them directly. Write the post in the content/posts/building-an-ai-image-generator/building-an-ai-image-generator.md file. Read my other posts to determine my voice and writing style, and then imitate those. I incuded two images, one is a house, and one is the same house with a porch added. This was generated by the app. My excitement for the app peaked when my wife started using it a lot to see what renovations we could do to houses that are on the market, since we are looking to move. Overall, I want to to tell the story about how the new Gemini image generation model, called "Nano Banana" came out, but initially it was only availble via API. I wanted to play with it, so I figured I'd write an android app to use the API. So I experimented with using Android Studio, then using Cursor to help write the app, and just using android studio for the build process. Then I started experimenting with Codex writing the app, and using command line tools to build and test the app. I ended up using a workflow where I had Codex, with full code analysis, develop a detailed implementation plan, then I gave that plan to ChatGPT and Gemini for feedback and analysis. I modified the plan based on the input of the two LLMs, plus my intended direction, roadmap, and architectural preferences. With a formalized plan, I had codex iterate through, testing every step, and doing manual debugging, plus LLM-asssited debugging. I learned a ton about how firebase works, since that's the backed for the app, as well as the process of launching an android app. I didn't realize I needed 12 beta testers, and then had to wait 14 days before I could submit my app for approval in the production Play Store, so that was a learning. But I didn't mind so much, because I kept adding features, engaging with my testers, and getting their feedback on the roadmap. And they sent me samples of what they were creating with the app! I got to see my friends vacation photos, but cartoon-ified. One tester took a school photo of his son, removed the background, and then sent that image on to a laser engraver to create a wood-burning photo of his son! A lot of fun creations coming in from the testers. So now it's out there for people to use and play with. Do you have any questions for me before you write this in a blog post? Also write this prompt in a text file next to the markdown, so I have it for reference.
