I'm a technologist who's followed my curiosity through various roles in software development, agile leadership, and now data analytics. This blog documents my ongoing journey of learning and exploration in technology.

## Professional Background
I got my start in computers by hacking around on a Commodore 64. I distinctly remember loading an ASCII bowling game, and finding out that I could see the source code before running the program. Not knowing what source code was at the time, I simply saw the word "BOWLING", as it appeared on the title screen. Being in elementary school at the time, I changed it to "POOPING", ran the program, saw my changes, and my life was set on a very specific course.

From these humble beginnings, I went on to study computer networking through college. Upon graduating, I immediately began a career in web development, because CISCO certifications are hard. Early career HTML, CSS, JS, Classic ASP and PHP got me started in the world of software development. As technologies evolved, I barely did, continuing my skillset and going moderately deep in the PHP and WordPress world. I dabbled in AWS architecture in the early AWS days, and eventually found more joy at the intersection of people and technology than I did staying heads down at the keyboard.

Those interests led me into the world of Agile, and I became a Scrum Master. I loved working with a small focused team, and we did a lot of things that weren't really Scrum, but worked well for us. I ended up drinking the Scaled Agile Framework Cool-Aid, and even did a little SAFe consulting. This led me to Portfolio Manager role.

Trying to scale Agile was a frustrating experience. I wasn't close to the work, and I didn't feel like I was providing value. In my free time, I was learning about machine learning, artificial intelligence, blockchain technologies, and other technological interests. My passions didn't lie with the Scaled Agile Framework.

Disillusioned with SAFe, I found an opportunity to be a product manager for a data analytics team. I took a risk and pursued it, and the manager took a risk on me and hired me. That's where our story begins, and the impetus for this website. I'm learning a lot, and I want to document what I'm learning.

## Personal Background
I spend the bulk of my days in front of a computer. When I'm not here, I like to be outside. I enjoy skiing, ultimate frisbee, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, kiteboarding, hiking, traveling, and pretty much anything active. I like to do these things with family as much as possible, and I also enjoy amateur videography. That allows me to capture memories in a compelling way that I can enjoy with my wife and kids, and extended family.
